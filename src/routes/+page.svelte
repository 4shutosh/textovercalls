			Have you ever been deep in focus, only to be interrupted by an unexpected
			call? It breaks your momentum, wastes time, leaves you distracted, and
			derails your day.

			Texts are great. Done right, they let you communicate without disrupting
			someone’s work, save time, and boost productivity.

		<p class="mt-4">
			Explain what you need, why it matters, and how urgent it is, all in the
			most concise way possible. This way, you respect each other’s time and
			make things easier for everyone.
